# GuessTheFlag
GuessTheFlag is a simple iOS game where users test their knowledge of world flags. The app displays a country name and three flag options, and the player must guess the correct flag. Each correct answer awards points, while incorrect guesses don't affect the score. A fun way to learn and challenge yourself on flags from around the world!
The source learning is from 2nd project of course "100 Days of SwiftUI" (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

## Goals
1. Display a main view showing the country name, three flag options, and the current score.
